Intro to Deep Learning 

We are building a model to differentiate stars, galaxies, and quasars from each other. We first build a model based purely on feature data, and then a model based purely on image data. We will then compare the two models to each other to see which is the better approach.

Our data comes from the [SDSS17 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stellar-classification-dataset-sdss17), which pulls from the [Sloan Digital Sky Survey](https://www.sdss4.org/dr17/data_access/#Images). A web scraper is built to download the corresponding image to each entry in the set.
