# nasaDL
Intro to Deep Learning 
- Classifying: stars, galaxies, quasar
- Potential route: use first column and use API to pull image
--> run DL model on the csv file and the image itself and compare the results

Build initial model
Trying out different optimizers, layers, loss, epochs etc; different testing/training splits

Lorraine: understand data
Olivia: look into intial model
Elena: work on image API

In one week: run on diff parameters
In two weeks: recovene + reevaluate
